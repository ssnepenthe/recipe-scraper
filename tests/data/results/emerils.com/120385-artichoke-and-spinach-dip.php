Whisk in the milk and bring the liquid up to a boil. Season with salt and cayenne to taste and simmer for 5 to 6 minutes, or until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the cheeses. Set the sauce aside.',

Add the garlic and artichokes and sauté for 4 minutes. Season the vegetables with salt and cayenne. Remove the spinach and artichokes from the heat and turn into a mixing bowl. Fold the béchamel sauce into the vegetables. Transfer the mixture to a baking pan and bake the dip for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the top is golden brown.',
