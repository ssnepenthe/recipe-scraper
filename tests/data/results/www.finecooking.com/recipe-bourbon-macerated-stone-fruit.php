    'description' => 'By soaking in spirits, stone fruit becomes something new, a complex mingling of flavors and textures. The fruit and liquid have many uses: a tasty dessert on its own topped with a dollop of whipped cream; a sauce for ice cream or cake; or a filling for pie or cake. Taste your fruit first, and adjust the amount of sugar as necessary. The intent of any maceration is never to overwhelm the flavor of the fruit with sugar.',
