        '1 lb. fresh or frozen huckleberries (about 3 cups)',
        '8 oz. fresh or frozen blackberries or raspberries (about 1-1/2 cups)',
        '7 oz. (1 cup) confectioners\' sugar',
        '1 oz. (1/4 cup) cornstarch, mixed with 3 Tbs. water',
        '1-1/2 tsp. finely grated lemon zest',
        '1 Tbs. fresh lemon juice',
        '1 Tbs. vanilla bean paste or pure vanilla extract',
        '6-3/4 oz. (1-1/2 cups) unbleached all-purpose flour',
        '2 tsp. granulated sugar',
        '1/2 tsp. table salt',
        '5-1/2 oz. (11 Tbs.) unsalted butter, cold and cut into 1/2-inch cubes',
        '1 large egg yolk',
        '3 Tbs. whole milk',
        '1 large egg, beaten with 1 Tbs. water',
        '6 Tbs. sanding sugar, for finishing',

    'instructions' => [
        'Combine the berries and confectioners\' sugar in a medium heavy-duty pot over medium-low heat. Bring to a gentle boil, stirring frequently. remove the pan from the heat and add the cornstarch mixture in a steady stream, stirring constantly. return the pot to the heat and cook, stirring, until the berry mixture begins to thicken, then boil for 2 minutes to completely cook the cornstarch. add the lemon zest and juice, and vanilla. remove from the heat and let cool completely. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours (and up to 3 days). After chilling, the consistency of the mixture should resemble thick pie filling.',
        'Combine the flour, granulated sugar, and salt in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the butter and mix on low speed until the mixture looks sandy and there are no pieces of butter larger than a pea, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the side and bottom of the bowl with a spatula. (If mixing by hand, use a pastry cutter or two forks to mix the butter into the flour.)',
        'In a small bowl, combine the egg yolk and milk. With the mixer on low speed, add the yolk mixture to the flour mixture and mix just until the dough comes together, about 15 seconds; the dough will be somewhat soft and pliable. (If mixing by hand, add the yolk mixture to the flour and mix gently with a fork until the liquid is well distributed. The dough will still look crumbly and dry. Transfer the dough to a clean counter and work it with the heel of your hand, pushing and smearing it away from you, gathering it up with a bench scraper, and repeating until the dough comes together and is somewhat soft and pliable.)',
        'Turn the dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap, shape it into a disk, wrap it in the plastic, and let rest in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes before rolling it out.',
        'Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 350Â°F. Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment.',
        'Remove the dough from the refrigerator; if the dough is very firm, let it sit at room temperature just until pliable enough to work with. Divide the dough evenly into 6 pieces and shape into balls. On a floured surface, roll each ball into a 1/4-inch-thick round, about 5 inches across. (It\'s fine if the edges are a little ragged.)',
        'Place 3 Tbs. of the fruit filling in the center of each dough round, leaving a 3/4-inch border (reserve extra filling for another use). Fold the edge of the dough over the edge of the fruit filling, pleating the dough as you go to maintain the circular shape. Transfer to the baking sheets and refrigerate for 15 minutes.',
        'Brush the egg mixture over the edges of each pastry. Sprinkle 2 tsp. of the sanding sugar over the top of each croustade. Bake until the dough is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer the baking sheets to a rack to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature',
