It\'s easier to cut and easier to serve, which means it\'s easier to eat, which is always a plus in my book. It also makes these perfect for a potluck dinner, or any place you need to take a portable dessert!',

Pour the crumbs into the prepared pan and press the crumbs firmly into an even layer. Set aside.',

Finally, open the door halfway and leave it in the oven for an additional 10 minutes. Remove the cheesecake and let it cool completely.',
        'For the topping, add blackberries, sugar, and 1/4 cup water to a saucepan. Bring it to a boil and cook until the juices thicken slightly, about 4-5 minutes. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with 4 tablespoons water to make a slurry, then add it to the berries. Let it boil for another 1 to 2 minutes, then turn off the heat and allow to cool.',
