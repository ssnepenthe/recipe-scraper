Drizzle the pork with the oil.',
        'TO GRILL: Grease the grill with grapeseed oil. Adjust the grill flame setting to medium to medium low. Place the loin on the grill and cook, turning often, until no longer translucent inside and cooked through, or until it registers 145˚F on an instant-read thermometer, 20 to 25 minutes. Let the loin rest for 5 minutes before slicing, then serve with the salsa.',
        'TO ROAST: Place the pork in a 7 × 11-inch baking dish and roast on the lower rack, uncovered, for 35 to 40 minutes until cooked through and no longer pink in the center, and it registers 145˚F on an instant-read thermometer. Let the loin rest for 5 minutes before slicing, then serve with the salsa.',
