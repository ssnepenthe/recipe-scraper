        'Preheat broiler with rack 6 inches from heating element. Melt butter in a 10-inch broilerproof nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add scallions and 1/4 teaspoon salt; cook until tender, 2 to 5 minutes. Stir in zucchini and cook until tender, 4 to 8 minutes. (This ensures that the vegetables are cooked and won\'t release extra moisture, which would make the frittata tough and watery.)',
        'Meanwhile, beat together eggs and milk with a fork (it gives you more speed and agility than a whisk here) until well combined. Stir in basil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Pour egg mixture into skillet; cook over medium-high, stirring with a spatula to create large curds, until eggs are wet on top but otherwise set throughout, 2 to 3 minutes.',
        'Sprinkle with provolone, pressing about half down into eggs. Transfer to oven; broil until puffed and browning in spots and eggs are just set, 1 to 2 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before slicing. Frittata can be served hot or at room temperature.',
