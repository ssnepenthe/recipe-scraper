    'description' => 'Aleppo is a Middle Eastern ground pepper with moderate heat and fruity notes. You can substitute 1⁄2 teaspoon ground red pepper flakes. This technique steams the corn in its husk right on the grill. Some smoke flavor permeates the corn, but not as much as when it rests on the grill rack without husks. The husks and silk are very easy to remove after the corn is cooked.',
