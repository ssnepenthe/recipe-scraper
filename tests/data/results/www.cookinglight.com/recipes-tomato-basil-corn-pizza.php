    'description' => 'A sprinkling of cornmeal keeps the dough from sticking to the pizza stone and gets the bottom of the crust extra-crispy. If you don\'t have a rectangular pizza stone, use a heavy baking sheet instead. You can often find fresh mozzarella in the specialty cheese section of the grocery store. A drizzle of tangy balsamic glaze provides the perfect balance to the sweet summer vegetables. Serve with a green side salad. Allowing the dough to come to room temperature will ease the rolling-out process. Height-of-summer tomatoes are the stars here. Look to refrigerated fresh pizza dough for pizzeria-quality pies at home.',
