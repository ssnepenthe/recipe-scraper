    'description' => 'This quick, satisfying breakfast is loaded with anti-inflammatory foods: extra-virgin olive oil, avocado, tomatoes, quinoa, and omega-3 eggs. For even more anti-inflammatory benefit, serve with an orange or grapefruit. Omega-3-enriched eggs come from hens that are fed a diet rich in omega-3s (usually containing flaxseed). They\'re easy to find; just look closely at labels on egg cartons. We call for cooked quinoa here-a perfect use for leftovers. Or pick up a timesaving package of precooked (unseasoned) quinoa in the freezer section or the grains aisle of your supermarket, as more and more manufacturers are offering this convenience.',
