        'In a medium bowl, whisk together sugar, eggs, and vanilla, then in a second medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Add melted chocolate to sugar mixture and whisk to combine. Add flour mixture and chocolate chips and gently fold until just combined and streak free.',
        'Pour brownie batter into prepared baking pan and smooth top. Bake until just set, 12 to 15 minutes, then let cool on a wire rack. Reduce oven temperature to 325°.',
        'Make the cheesecake: In a large bowl using a hand mixer or in the bowl of a stand mixer using the whisk attachment, beat cream cheese on medium speed, scraping down bowl as necessary, until completely smooth, 3 to 4 minutes. Add sugar, pumpkin pie spice, and salt and beat, scraping down bowl as necessary, until smooth and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add vanilla and beat 30 seconds, then add eggs one at a time, beating 1 minute after each addition and scraping down bowl as necessary. Add pumpkin, heavy cream, and sour cream and beat on low until completely smooth and streak-free, about 1 minute.',
        'Pour cheesecake batter over cooled brownies and smooth top. Bake until set around the edges and just barely jiggling in the center, 45 minutes, then let cool to room temperature on a wire rack. Once completely cool, loosely cover cheesecake with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator until firm, 3 hours, or up to overnight.',
