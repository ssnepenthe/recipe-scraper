        'Make the ice cream: Place a loaf pan in the freezer to chill before starting recipe. Make espresso, pour into small saucepan, and stir in sugar. Boil on medium high heat to reduce the liquid, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool to room temperature.',
        'With a hand or stand mixer, whip heavy cream to firm peaks. Add in condensed milk and re-whip to soft peaks. Add in the cooled espresso syrup while continuing to whip the mixture. Once combined, pour mixture into the chilled loaf pan and freeze overnight.',
        'Make the cookies: Mix all dry ingredients except the chocolate and set aside. In another bowl, stir together butter, sugars and vanilla extract until creamed. Add in egg and stir until combined, then add in dry ingredients and mix well. Mix in the chocolate chips and chill in refrigerator for 2 hours before making the sandwiches.',
        'Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Make large golf-ball-size balls of dough and place them on a parchment-lined cookie sheet, leaving plenty of space for cookies to spread out. (These are large cookies, so you will have to bake a few at a time.) Bake for about 15 minutes until light golden brown. Cool to room temperature and then chill cookies in freezer until you are ready to make the ice cream sandwiches.',
        'Assemble the sandwiches: Place a scoop of ice cream onto flat side of chilled cookie, top with another cookie, and serve.',
