Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl, pressing down on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids. You should have about 3 cups very thick purée. Add crushed peppercorns, sugar, salt, and bay leaves and stir until most of sugar is dissolved. Transfer to a 1-qt. jar or an airtight container. Cover and chill 8-12 hours.',
