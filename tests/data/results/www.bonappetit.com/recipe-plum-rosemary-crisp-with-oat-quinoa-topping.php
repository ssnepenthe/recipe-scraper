        'Filling',
        'Brush inside of a shallow 2-qt. baking dish with butter. Toss plums, rosemary, and 1 Tbsp. raw sugar in a large bowl. Let sit, tossing once or twice, until plums release their juices, 15-20 minutes.',
        'Add vinegar, zest, salt, and remaining ⅓ cup raw sugar to plums and toss to combine. Sprinkle flour evenly over top and toss until flour is no longer visible.',
        'Transfer filling to prepared baking dish and spread out to make an even layer; set aside.',
        'Topping and Assembly',
        'Preheat oven to 350°. Whisk oats, quinoa flour, raw sugar, salt, cardamom, and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Drizzle butter over mixture, tossing with a fork to incorporate. As soon as all the butter has been added, work with your hands until no dry spots remain and mixture holds together in clumps. Scatter over a rimmed baking sheet and let sit uncovered at room temperature until slightly dried out (this will help it crisp in the oven when baking), 10-15 minutes.',
        'Scatter topping evenly over reserved filling. Bake crisp on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet until topping is golden and crisp and fruit juices are bubbling around the edges, 35-45 minutes. Let cool at least 15 minutes before serving.',
        'Do Ahead: Topping can be made 2 days ahead; after drying out, cover and chill. Crisp can be baked 8 hours ahead; let cool, then tent with foil. Reheat, uncovered, in 350° oven 10-15 minutes.',
