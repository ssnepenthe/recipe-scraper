        'Place potatoes in a medium pot; add cold water to cover by 1". Season with salt, bring to a boil, and cook until potatoes are fork-tender, 12-15 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl of ice water and chill until cold, about 3 minutes. Transfer to paper towels and pat dry, reserving bowl of ice water.',
        'Meanwhile, bring another medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add green beans and cook until crisp-tender, 2-4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to ice water; reserve hot water in pot. Chill beans until cold, about 3 minutes. Transfer to paper towels and pat dry, reserving bowl of ice water.',
        'Return water in green bean pot to a boil, carefully add eggs, and cook 8 minutes. Transfer eggs to ice water and chill until cold, about 5 minutes. Peel; set aside.',
        'Combine shallot, lemon zest, lemon juice, Dijon, honey, pepper, and 1/4 tsp. salt in a medium bowl. Whisk in 3 Tbsp. oil in a slow, steady stream, then whisk in 1 Tbsp. dill.',
        'Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a small saucepan over medium-high. Add capers and cook, swirling pan occasionally, until capers burst and are crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer capers with slotted spoon to paper towels. Let oil cool.',
        'Toss green beans in a large bowl with half of the dressing. Arrange on a platter. Transfer potatoes to same bowl and toss with 1 Tbsp. dressing; arrange in a section on top of green beans. Toss radishes with 1 Tbsp. dressing in same bowl; arrange in another section on top of green beans. Cut eggs into quarters and place eggs and olives in sections on top of green beans, letting some beans show through.
