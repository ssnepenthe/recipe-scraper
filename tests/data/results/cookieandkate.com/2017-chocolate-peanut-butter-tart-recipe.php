    'description' => 'This chocolate peanut butter tart recipe is creamy and delicious! It\'s also vegan, gluten free, and naturally sweetened, believe it or not! While this recipe is pretty easy to make, it requires some cooling/chilling time. Be sure to place cans of regular coconut milk in your refrigerator at least 12 hours in advance (I usually keep a few in my fridge at all times). Recipe yields one 9" tart (about 8 to 10 slices).',

    'ingredients' => [
        '2 cups old-fashioned oats (certified gluten-free if necessary)',
        '1/2 cup raw almonds',
        '1/2 teaspoon salt',
        'Pinch of ground cinnamon',
        '1/3 cup melted coconut oil',
        '3 to 4 tablespoons maple syrup or honey, as needed',
        '1 1/4 cups bittersweet chocolate chips (about 60% cacao content is perfect)',
        '1 can (14 ounces) regular coconut milk, chilled at least 12 hours',
        '1/4 cup maple syrup or honey, to taste',
        '1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract',
        'Dash of salt',
        '1 can (14 ounces) regular coconut milk, chilled at least 12 hours',
        '1/2 cup peanut butter',
        '2 tablespoons maple syrup or honey',
        '1 teaspoon vanilla extract',
        'Light dusting of cocoa powder (sprinkle it over the top in a sifter or fine mesh sieve)',
        'Sprinkles (I used these naturally colored sprinkles)',

    'instructions' => [
        'To make the crust: Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and lightly oil a 9" tart pan, preferably one with a removable base, with melted coconut oil.',
        'In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the S blade, combine the oats, almonds, salt, and cinnamon. Process the mixture until the pieces resemble coarse sand. Pour the coconut oil and 3 tablespoons sweetener into the mixture and process until it forms a malleable dough. Add up to 1 tablespoon more sweetener if the dough needs a bit more moisture to come together.',
        'Scoop the dough into your prepared tart pan and fold in any almond or oat crumbs that haven\'t already incorporated into the dough. Press the dough into the tart pan evenly, using the heel of your hand to press the bottom smooth, which will help push the crust up the sides. Aim for even thickness across the bottom and up the edges (I didn\'t go quite far enough up the edges in my photos). Prick the base of the crust all over with a fork. (If the dough isn\'t cooperating, set the crust in the refrigerator for 10 minutes to firm it up before baking.)',
        'Bake the unfilled tart crust for 12 to 14 minutes, until it\'s firm to the touch and turning lightly golden at the edges. Place it on a cooling rack until cooled, about 30 minutes.',
        'Meanwhile, to make the chocolate layer: Gently melt the chocolate chips in a double boiler or in the microwave in a microwave-safe bowl, stirring after every 30 second interval. Let the chocolate cool for 15 to 20 minutes, so that it\'s still warm enough to mix with the coconut cream, but not so warm that it melts the cream.',
        'To make the peanut butter whipped cream topping: Open one chilled can of coconut milk. You should see a thick, white layer of condensed coconut cream on top (if not, save the contents of this can for another use and open another can). Scoop the condensed coconut cream into a medium mixing bowl, leaving the more clear coconut "water" behind (you can save the coconut water for smoothies or discard it). Add the peanut butter, sweetener and vanilla extract. Using an electric hand mixer, beat the mixture until it is smooth and light, with soft peaks.',
        'To finish the chocolate layer: Once the chocolate has cooled, open another chilled can of coconut milk. Scoop the condensed coconut cream into a clean, medium-sized mixing bowl. Add the semi-cooled chocolate, sweetener, vanilla and salt. Using an electric hand mixer, beat the mixture until it is smooth and somewhat fluffy. Taste and add additional sweetener if desired, keeping in mind that once chilled, it will taste slightly less sweet.',
        'Scoop the chocolate mixture into the baked tart crust. Use a rubber or silicone spatula to evenly distribute the filling and smooth the top. Rinse off and dry your spatula, then use it to spread the whipped cream layer on top, leaving an inch bare around the edges so the chocolate layer remains visible. Chill the tart for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours or longer, so the coconut whipped cream has time to set.',
        'Before serving, sprinkle with cocoa powder and/or sprinkle, if desired. If your tart pan has a removable bottom, carefully remove the tart so it\'s easier to slice through the edges. Slice the tart into even wedges using a sharp chef\'s knife, wiping off the blade after every slice. Serve immediately. This tart keeps well, chilled and covered, for up to 5 days.',

        'Make it dairy free: Use dairy-free chocolate chips. I like Enjoy Life brand, which is available at Target.',
        'Make it vegan: Use dairy-free chocolate chips, and maple syrup instead of honey.',
        'Make it peanut free: Omit the peanut butter for a chocolate cream tart, or replace the peanut butter with almond butter.',
        'Change it up: You can omit the peanut butter for a chocolate cream tart. You can turn this into a Mexican-ish chocolate tart by omitting the peanut butter and replacing it with Â½ teaspoon ground cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. Turn it into a coffee chocolate tart by omitting the peanut butter and replacing it with 2 tablespoons triple-strength brewed coffee, cooled, and 1 teaspoon ground coffee (medium grind or finer).',
