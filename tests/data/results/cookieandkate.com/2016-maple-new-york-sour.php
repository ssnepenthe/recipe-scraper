    'description' => 'Learn how to make a New York sour cocktail. I sweeten mine with maple syrup instead of simple syrup, which tastes amazing! They\'re easy to make, too. Recipe as written below yields one cocktail. You can make two or three cocktails at once in your cocktail shaker; just pour them over ice and top each one with a wine float as explained below.',

    'ingredients' => [
        '2 ounces (1/4 cup) rye whiskey or bourbon (I like Rieger\'s brand-a local Kansas City distillery-and Bulleit)',
        '1 ounce (2 tablespoons) fresh lemon juice',
        '2 to 4 teaspoons maple syrup, to taste (I like 3 teaspoons, which is the equivalent of Â½ ounce or 1 tablespoon)',
        '1/2 ounce (1 tablespoon) fruity red wine*',

        'Fill a cocktail shaker or mason jar about two-thirds full with ice. Pour in the whiskey, lemon juice and maple syrup. Securely fasten the lid and shake for about 30 seconds.',
        'Pour fresh ice into your cocktail glass. Strain the cold whiskey sour mixture into the glass. Slowly pour the wine over the back of a spoon held just above the drink\'s surface, so it has a nice layered effect. Sip up!',

        '*Wine notes: Look for wine descriptions that suggest notes of cherry/plum/berries, etc. and you should find a winner. I just wouldn\'t use a particularly spicy or dry red wine here. I used an organic 2014 cabernet sauvignon from Trader Joe\'s labeled "Rare Earth."',
