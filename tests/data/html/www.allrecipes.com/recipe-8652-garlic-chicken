The recipe calls for 2 tsp.of garlic crushed(not 2 cloves).This could be why everyone says to double up on garlic because they are counting cloves instead of teaspoons of garlic. I used 7 BIG cloves of garlic and upped the oil 1/4c and bread crumbs, Cheese combo 1/4c for 6 breast. Baked for 30 min. Per--fect. This is not fried/baked chicken. This is a Exquisite dish and the aroma is Heavenly. IF there are left over,place on a salad for a nice lunch.  Encore",

If you are looking for a strong garlic taste this is not it. However since I was cooking for a one year old and a picky husband the taste was perfect. The recipe is super fast taking only a few minutes to warm the oil and roll the chicken in the coating. The only thing I did wrong was using chicken breast tenders rather than chicken breasts. I don't recommend this. You have to decrease the cooking time to prevent the chicken from drying out and the coating does not get crispy. The chicken was just starting to get crispy when I had to remove it from the oven. I think it would have been even better if I had been able to cook it at least another 15 minutes. I will make it again using whole chicken breasts in the future.",

I changed this: I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs because they are RELIABLY more moist then breasts (always trim off any extra fat with kitchen sheers). I ran the garlic and olive oil through my mini-blender so it was like a smooth garlic emulsion oil (I did warm the oil in the microwave as suggested).  I tossed 1/2 the chicken into a ziplock, poured in the garlic oil....tossed in the other half of the chicken and closed the bag.  I hand squished the garlic oil all throughout the chicken by kneading the bag. That saves the messy step of hand dipping each piece into the oil and then into the crumbs.  I used Italian bread crumbs with the grated cheese and coated the pieces as suggested.  It was excellent!!.  It really was very easy, tasty and light!! Baked 400° for 23 minutes.",

                                          I&apos;ve made this 8 times now. The first 7 times, I skipped the Parmesan, thinking it would not make that much of a difference. Boy, was I wrong! Last night I added the Parmesan, and it took this dish from good to excellent. Don&apos;t skip the Parmesan! I  also use butter instead of olive oil; it gives the dish a richer taste. This is a wonderful recipe for everyday or company, and the best part is you always have the ingredients on hand.

                                          We&apos;ve made basically the same recipe for years using low or no-fat italian dressing instead of the olive oil.  Just as tasty and a LOT less fat.  No real recipe required - just dip chicken in dressing then dredge in a mixture of equal parts crumbs and parmesan, seasoned with additional garlic and herbs if you&apos;d like.  To me, this was just much too greasy.

                                  I&apos;ve made this 8 times now. The first 7 times, I skipped the Parmesan, thinking it would not make that much of a difference. Boy, was I wrong! Last night I added the Parmesan, and it took this dish from good to excellent. Don&apos;t skip the Parmesan! I  also use butter instead of olive oil; it gives the dish a richer taste. This is a wonderful recipe for everyday or company, and the best part is you always have the ingredients on hand.

                                  Applauds to Carol.The BEST chicken breast ever. I am not a enthusiastic chicken lover and I find it difficult to find a good moist chicken breast recipe with flavor. The recipe calls for 2 tsp.of garlic crushed(not 2 cloves).This could be why everyone says to double up on garlic because they are counting cloves instead of teaspoons of garlic. I used 7 BIG cloves of garlic and upped the oil 1/4c and bread crumbs, Cheese combo 1/4c for 6 breast. Baked for 30 min. Per--fect. This is not fried/baked chicken. This is a Exquisite dish and the aroma is Heavenly. IF there are left over,place on a salad for a nice lunch.  Encore

                                  We&apos;ve made basically the same recipe for years using low or no-fat italian dressing instead of the olive oil.  Just as tasty and a LOT less fat.  No real recipe required - just dip chicken in dressing then dredge in a mixture of equal parts crumbs and parmesan, seasoned with additional garlic and herbs if you&apos;d like.  To me, this was just much too greasy.

                                  All I can say about this chicken is OH-MY-GAWD! It is so delicious and so easy! Don&apos;t make any changes to this recipe, it&apos;s perfect as it is.  I followed the alfredo sauce recipe on this site and made fettucine alfredo to go with this chicken.  My husband took one bite of the chicken and said &quot;why do we ever eat out!?&quot; You must try this recipe! It&apos;s a keeper! The absolute best thing is how easy it is to make such a tasty dish!

                                  This recipe was super easy. The chicken has a very nice garlic smell while cooking. The taste is mild and not over powering. If you are looking for a strong garlic taste this is not it. However since I was cooking for a one year old and a picky husband the taste was perfect. The recipe is super fast taking only a few minutes to warm the oil and roll the chicken in the coating. The only thing I did wrong was using chicken breast tenders rather than chicken breasts. I don&apos;t recommend this. You have to decrease the cooking time to prevent the chicken from drying out and the coating does not get crispy. The chicken was just starting to get crispy when I had to remove it from the oven. I think it would have been even better if I had been able to cook it at least another 15 minutes. I will make it again using whole chicken breasts in the future.

                                  Pretty yummy! Very easy. The chicken was tender and had a nice flavor. I asked my husband if it was a keeper and he said &quot;Oh yeah!&quot; The only thing is I bought the real parmesan cheese still in shredded form and couldn&apos;t figure how the cheese and bread crumbs were going to stick to the chicken! My husband said,&quot;I think you&apos;re supposed to use the powdered stuff in the green can.&quot; Oopps. That makes sense. Make sure you start off with the stuff in the green can. You know that stuff you put on spaghetti!

                                  WOW! Delicious with little effort!  I changed this: I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs because they are RELIABLY more moist then breasts (always trim off any extra fat with kitchen sheers). I ran the garlic and olive oil through my mini-blender so it was like a smooth garlic emulsion oil (I did warm the oil in the microwave as suggested).  I tossed 1/2 the chicken into a ziplock, poured in the garlic oil....tossed in the other half of the chicken and closed the bag.  I hand squished the garlic oil all throughout the chicken by kneading the bag. That saves the messy step of hand dipping each piece into the oil and then into the crumbs.  I used Italian bread crumbs with the grated cheese and coated the pieces as suggested.  It was excellent!!.  It really was very easy, tasty and light!! Baked 400&#xB0; for 23 minutes.

                                  For those who prefer a stronger garlic flavour instead of olive oil substitute garlic oil or make your own by adding 2 Tbs chopped garlic to 1 cup olive or canola oil,let stand for 24 hrs in fridge and use within a week.  Add GRANULATED garlic powder to the crumb mixture, use Romano cheese instead of Parmesan for a more distinct flavour.

                                  pounded the chicken breasts so they would be more tender, also added lots more garlic, used italian seasoned bread crumbs, and needed almost two times the amount of crumbs anc cheese asked for. overall, very delicious.

                            I&apos;ve made this 8 times now. The first 7 times, I skipped the Parmesan, thinking it would not make that much of a difference. Boy, was I wrong! Last night I added the Parmesan, and it took this dish from good to excellent. Don&apos;t skip the Parmesan! I  also use butter instead of olive oil; it gives the dish a richer taste. This is a wonderful recipe for everyday or company, and the best part is you always have the ingredients on hand.

Last night I added the Parmesan, and it took this dish from good to excellent. Don&apos;t skip the Parmesan! I  also use butter instead of olive oil; it gives the dish a richer taste. This is a wonderful recipe for everyday or company, and the best part is you always have the ingredients on hand.

                            Applauds to Carol.The BEST chicken breast ever. I am not a enthusiastic chicken lover and I find it difficult to find a good moist chicken breast recipe with flavor. The recipe calls for 2 tsp.of garlic crushed(not 2 cloves).This could be why everyone says to double up on garlic because they are counting cloves instead of teaspoons of garlic. I used 7 BIG cloves of garlic and upped the oil 1/4c and bread crumbs, Cheese combo 1/4c for 6 breast. Baked for 30 min. Per--fect. This is not fried/baked chicken. This is a Exquisite dish and the aroma is Heavenly. IF there are left over,place on a salad for a nice lunch.  Encore

                            We&apos;ve made basically the same recipe for years using low or no-fat italian dressing instead of the olive oil.  Just as tasty and a LOT less fat.  No real recipe required - just dip chicken in dressing then dredge in a mixture of equal parts crumbs and parmesan, seasoned with additional garlic and herbs if you&apos;d like.  To me, this was just much too greasy.

                            All I can say about this chicken is OH-MY-GAWD! It is so delicious and so easy! Don&apos;t make any changes to this recipe, it&apos;s perfect as it is.  I followed the alfredo sauce recipe on this site and made fettucine alfredo to go with this chicken.  My husband took one bite of the chicken and said &quot;why do we ever eat out!?&quot; You must try this recipe! It&apos;s a keeper! The absolute best thing is how easy it is to make such a tasty dish!

                            This recipe was super easy. The chicken has a very nice garlic smell while cooking. The taste is mild and not over powering. If you are looking for a strong garlic taste this is not it. However since I was cooking for a one year old and a picky husband the taste was perfect. The recipe is super fast taking only a few minutes to warm the oil and roll the chicken in the coating. The only thing I did wrong was using chicken breast tenders rather than chicken breasts. I don&apos;t recommend this. You have to decrease the cooking time to prevent the chicken from drying out and the coating does not get crispy. The chicken was just starting to get crispy when I had to remove it from the oven. I think it would have been even better if I had been able to cook it at least another 15 minutes. I will make it again using whole chicken breasts in the future.

                            Pretty yummy! Very easy. The chicken was tender and had a nice flavor. I asked my husband if it was a keeper and he said &quot;Oh yeah!&quot; The only thing is I bought the real parmesan cheese still in shredded form and couldn&apos;t figure how the cheese and bread crumbs were going to stick to the chicken! My husband said,&quot;I think you&apos;re supposed to use the powdered stuff in the green can.&quot; Oopps. That makes sense. Make sure you start off with the stuff in the green can. You know that stuff you put on spaghetti!

                            WOW! Delicious with little effort!  I changed this: I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs because they are RELIABLY more moist then breasts (always trim off any extra fat with kitchen sheers). I ran the garlic and olive oil through my mini-blender so it was like a smooth garlic emulsion oil (I did warm the oil in the microwave as suggested).  I tossed 1/2 the chicken into a ziplock, poured in the garlic oil....tossed in the other half of the chicken and closed the bag.  I hand squished the garlic oil all throughout the chicken by kneading the bag. That saves the messy step of hand dipping each piece into the oil and then into the crumbs.  I used Italian bread crumbs with the grated cheese and coated the pieces as suggested.  It was excellent!!.  It really was very easy, tasty and light!! Baked 400&#xB0; for 23 minutes.

                            For those who prefer a stronger garlic flavour instead of olive oil substitute garlic oil or make your own by adding 2 Tbs chopped garlic to 1 cup olive or canola oil,let stand for 24 hrs in fridge and use within a week.  Add GRANULATED garlic powder to the crumb mixture, use Romano cheese instead of Parmesan for a more distinct flavour.
